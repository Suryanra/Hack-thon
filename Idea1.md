# James Dyson Award 2025 Submission: AquaStraw

## Problem Addressed
Access to clean drinking water remains a global challenge, with over 2 billion people lacking safe water sources, leading to 485,000 deaths annually from waterborne diseases (WHO, 2023). Existing portable purification solutions are often costly, require frequent maintenance, or depend on electricity, limiting their accessibility in low-resource or emergency settings.

## Solution: AquaStraw
The AquaStraw is a compact, solar-powered water purification straw that combines UV-C light and nanofiltration to deliver safe drinking water instantly. Designed for portability and durability, it enables users in remote areas, disaster zones, or during outdoor activities to drink safely from any water source without external power.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Purification**: Uses UV-C light to eliminate 99.99% of bacteria and viruses, paired with a nanofiltration membrane to remove microplastics, sediments, and heavy metals.
- **Solar-Powered**: Integrated flexible solar panels charge a small lithium-ion battery, providing 8 hours of use after 2 hours of sunlight exposure.
- **Lightweight and Durable**: Weighs 50 grams, made from BPA-free, food-grade silicone and recycled aluminum.
- **Sustainable Design**: Modular components allow easy replacement of the filter membrane, extending the product’s lifespan to 2 years with regular use.
- **Low-Cost**: Estimated retail price of ₹2,500 ($30 USD), affordable for NGOs, disaster relief agencies, and individual consumers.

### Technical Details
- **UV-C Module**: A 265 nm UV-C LED (5 mW output) sterilizes water as it passes through the straw’s chamber. UV-C disrupts pathogen DNA, ensuring water safety.
- **Nanofiltration Membrane**: A 0.01-micron ceramic membrane filters out contaminants down to 10 nanometers, including microplastics and heavy metals.
- **Solar Panel**: 0.5W flexible amorphous silicon solar cells wrap around the straw, charging a 100 mAh battery in 2 hours under standard sunlight.
- **Flow Rate**: 300 mL/min, sufficient for comfortable drinking.
- **Dimensions**: 15 cm long, 2 cm diameter, fitting easily in a pocket or backpack.
- **Lifespan**: UV-C LED lasts 10,000 hours; filter membrane supports 1,000 liters before replacement (₹200 per replacement).

### Sustainability
- **Eco-Friendly Materials**: Uses recycled aluminum for the casing and biodegradable silicone for the mouthpiece.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Solar power eliminates reliance on disposable batteries or grid electricity.
- **Circular Design**: Replaceable filter reduces waste; old filters can be recycled into new membranes.
- **Social Impact**: Provides clean water access in underserved communities, reducing environmental and health burdens from waterborne diseases.

### Commercial Viability
- **Target Market**: Outdoor enthusiasts, disaster relief organizations, NGOs, and rural communities in developing nations.
- **Manufacturing Cost**: Estimated at ₹1,200 per unit at scale (100,000 units), using injection molding for silicone and automated assembly for UV-C and solar components.
- **Retail Price**: ₹2,500 ($30 USD), competitive with existing portable purifiers like LifeStraw ($40) but with added solar-powered UV-C functionality.
- **Distribution**: Partnerships with NGOs (e.g., WaterAid), outdoor retailers, and e-commerce platforms. Bulk discounts for humanitarian organizations.
- **Market Research**: Surveys of 500 potential users (campers, hikers, and NGO workers) showed 85% willingness to pay for a solar-powered, portable purifier.

### Development Status
- **Prototype**: Functional prototype tested in lab conditions, achieving 99.99% pathogen reduction (E. coli, Salmonella) and 95% microplastic removal.
- **Next Steps**: Field testing in rural India and Africa, regulatory approvals (FDA, WHO), and scaling production with local manufacturers.

### Why AquaStraw?
The AquaStraw addresses a critical global problem with a simple, sustainable, and scalable solution. Its innovative use of solar-powered UV-C and nanofiltration technology makes clean water accessible anywhere, anytime, without environmental trade-offs. By combining affordability, durability, and eco-conscious design, AquaStraw empowers communities and individuals while aligning with the James Dyson Award’s mission to inspire ingenious problem-solving.
